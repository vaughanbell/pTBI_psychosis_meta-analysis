Code developed by Chi-King Yau and Vaughan Bell

This archive contains the R code for the analysis reported in the above study. The code is presented as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) which are documents that combine both code and the output in a form that can be viewed online, but also re-run and the results reproduced when accompanied by the original datasets.

This repository contains a dataset with the extracted meta-analytic data and a Jupyter notebook that reports the analysis and results

1.  [Yau_et_al_pTBI_psychosis_data.csv](https://github.com/vaughanbell/pTBI_psychosis_meta-analysis/blob/main/Yau_et_al_pTBI_psychosis_data.csv) - datafile that contains extracted data
2.  [Yau_et_al_pTBI_psychosis_meta.ipynb](https://github.com/vaughanbell/pTBI_psychosis_meta-analysis/blob/main/Yau_et_al_pTBI_psychosis_meta.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook that contains the reproducible analysis

### Platform and package versions

To aid reproducibility, the platform (hardware, operating system), R language version, and package versions used to generate the results are automatically generated at runtime and reported at the end of the Jupyter notebooks.
